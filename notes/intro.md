# Welcome to Django
Django is a high-level web framework written in Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

## Starting a Project
```bash
django-admin startproject <project_name> <folder_name>
```
Creates a project inside the folder with the given name. The folder name is optional, if not provided,
the project is created in the current directory and the project name is used as the folder name.

## Run the Server
Start the server from inside the project directory
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Runs the server on the default port 8000.

## Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations [app_name] # Creates migration files. If app_name is not provided, all apps are migrated.
python manage.py migrate
```

## Write a view
A view is a function that takes a request and returns a response. 
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
def my_view(request, *args, **kwargs):
    # args and kwargs are optional and are captured from the URL
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```

### Dango Project Structure
The django version of MVC is MVTU. It stands for Model, View, Template, URL. Django organises a project into apps. 
Each app has its own models, views, templates and urls.

#### Starting an App
```bash
python manage.py startapp <app_name>
```
After creating an app add it to the installed app array in the settings.py file.
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    # local apps
    'app_name.apps.AppNameConfig',
]

```

### Views
Views are the functions that handle requests and return responses. Within an app, views are defined in the
views.py file. Each view is a function that takes a request object and returns a response object. It can actually
be any callable object.
```python
# app/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")

# Using the render function to render a template
def home_template(request, name):
    # name argument comes from the URL
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'name': name})
```

### Urls
Each app may have a urls.py file that maps URLs to views provided by the app.
The urlpatterns is a list of path instances. Each path() instance maps a URL pattern to a view. The _path()_
function takes three arguments: *route* as a string or regex, *view* as function or class, *kwargs*, and, optional
*name* and *pattern* arguments as the case maybe. To namespace an app, the *app_name* variable is set in the urls.py file
of the app. 
```python
# app/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import HomeView
app_name = 'app'
urlpatterns = [
    path('', HomeView.as_view(), name='home'),
    # use angle brackets to capture a variable from the URL. The variable is passed to the view function.
    path('welcome/<name>/', HomeView.as_view(), name='home')
]
```
The project level  **urls.py** file combines the urls of all the apps in the project. It is the main URL configuration
file, and, should be in the folder containing the settings.py file .i.e. the project folder. It uses the **include()** function
to include the urls of all apps apart from the admin app.
```python
# project/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include
from django.contrib import admin
# assuming the app is named app
urlpatterns = [
    path('app/', include('app.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

### Templates
Templates are used to generate HTML dynamically. They are stored in the templates folder of the app.
Inside the templates folder another folder with the app name is created to store the templates. Alternatively, the
templates can be stored in the templates folder of the project. Point to it in the TEMPLATES variable of settings.py file. 
```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / "templates"],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
    },
]
```

### Models
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and
behaviors of the data you are storing. Django follows the **DRY** Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place
and automatically derive things from it. Models are defined in the models.py file of the app. Each model is a class that
inherits from the django.db.models.Model class. The attributes of the class represent the fields of the model.
The model class is used to create the database schema. 
```python
# app/models.py

from django.db import models
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()
```
After defining the model, create the migration files and apply them to the database.
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations [<app_name>] # Creates migration files. If app_name is not provided, all apps are migrated.
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate # Applies the migrations to the database.
```

### Admin
Django provides an admin interface that can be used to manage the database. To use the admin interface, register the models
in the *admin.py* file of the app. Create Superuser to access the admin interface.
```python
# app/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import MyModel
admin.site.register(MyModel)
```
create a superuser to access the admin interface, run the command below and follow the prompts
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser 
```

### Static
Djangoâ€™ s **STATICFILES_FINDERS** setting contains a list of finders that know how to discover static files from
various sources. Static files namespacing works similarly as template files namespacing, each app should have a static
folder with another folder inside with the app name for the static files. A static folder can also be created at the
project level point to it in the `STATICFILES_DIRS` variable of the settings.py file.
```python
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles" # new
STATICFILES_STORAGE = "django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage"
```
Run `collectstatic` to move to the appropriate storage location
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Testing
Tests are routines that check the operation of your code. Django has a test framework that can be used to test the apps.
The tests are written in the tests.py file of the app.
```bash
# Run the tests
python manage.py test

# Test an app
python manage.py test <app_name>
```
